- **Problem fixed** Takes care of randomizing levels, gold and traits
- **Easy** Great starter project for python learning
- **Flexible** Great for learning, testing, or creating characters for your own use
- **Educational** Helps students understand data types, built-in Python functions, imported libraries, loops and lists


## ℹ️ Overview

The purpose of this project is to show how Python can handle user input, process the given information, and produce new and randomized results each time. The code written generates npc characters for an open world game, each with a variety of attributes. When the code first runs, the user is asked to insert at least ten names. Then when entered, each name that the user had input will be listed in a clear format with their level, gold, fighting status and three traits. This uses basic programming structures. 


## 🚀 Usage
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Open the file called 'NPC_generator.py'
3. Run the file by clicking the run button
4. Enter at least ten names into the program when prompted
5. View the randomly generated NPC list with their attributes 
6. You can rerun the program to get a new set of NPCs every time
        
 **Example layout:** **ex. 10** (Lvl 11) has 2.33g of gold, can fight, and is known to be daring, cheerful, and cunning.
